Genetic Algorithm pseudocode

GA():
    createPopulation()
    for i in generations:
        evaluateFitness()
        sort()
        crossParents()
    evaluateFitness()
    sort()
    pickBestPath()
    visualizePath()

evaluateFitness():
    for chromosome in chromosomes:
        assign points and time from simulation result to chromosome

sort():
    sort chromosomes by highest points

crossParents():
    newPopulation = []
    append best path to newPopulation
    for i in population[::2]:
        partition chromosomes[i] and chromosomes[i+1] into desired chunks
        swap everyother chunk between the lists
        append both flattened lists to newPopulation
    chromosomes = newPopulation

visualizePath():
    run simulation with best path

createPopulation():
    chromosomes = []
    for I in population:
        for i in listLength:
            append random direction to chromosomes[I]
